1. Learn everything from the 'Demo' section.

2. In the 'Practice' section of task-1 "Basic Counter", make a 2-bit asynchronous basic binary counter using JK flip-flops. Remember to set J and K to 1. Observe that the flip-flops are negative edge triggered. Also try to find the ratio of rate of change of output of the output bits

3. Then, in task-2 "Ring Counter", implement a 3-bit synchronous ring counter using D flip-flops. Remember to set ORI to 0. Observe how ori's value change through the course of simulation. Observe how the three bits will form a ring.

4. After performing both the tasks observe that we need different number of flip-flops for making an n-bit counter.
