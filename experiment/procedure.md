1. Firstly learn everything from the 'Demo' section.

2. Then, test your understanding about counters in the 'Pretest' section.

3. Then in the 'Practice' section in the task-1 "Basic Counter", make a 2-bit asynchronous basic binary counter using JK flip-flops. Remember to set J and K to 1.

4. Then, in the task-2 "Ring Counter", implement a 3-bit ring counter using D flip-flops. Remember to set ORI to 0.

5. After that, test your understanding of the experiment in the 'Posttest' section.
